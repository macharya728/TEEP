The integration of advanced computer vision techniques has transformed the way athletic performance is monitored, analysed, and visualized. This project focuses on developing a real-time runner tracking and performance visualization system, leveraging the YOLOv11 object detection model to identify and track runners on a track. By filtering out non-relevant objects and assigning unique IDs to detected humans, the system ensures consistent tracking of individuals within predefined lane regions.

Using perspective transformation, the system dynamically overlays critical information such as each runnerâ€™s name, department, speed, and distance to the finish line directly onto the track in a 3D perspective. This feature enhances the viewing experience by providing an intuitive and immersive way to monitor performance. Additionally, the system automates race result determination by identifying the sequence in which runners cross the finish line and updating rankings in real time.

This project demonstrates the potential of integrating computer vision and real-time data visualization for improving the accuracy, efficiency, and engagement of athletic events. It offers a scalable and robust solution for race monitoring, athlete performance analysis, and audience interaction, with applications extending to sports analytics, event management, and broadcasting.
